<h2><a name="INTRODUCTION" id="INTRODUCTION"><i>INTRODUCTION.</i></a></h2>


<p>In spite of a considerable amount of
trade grumbling, the best part of the
market is still held by English fish, as a
glance at any time over the names on
the crates will show. The foreign importations,
though large, are not nearly
so extensive as might be supposed.</p>

<p>As a rule the north British ports furnish
the largest supply; the southern
ports suffer the most from foreign competition.
Continental freightage also is
light, and as the foreigner rarely keeps
very closely to the laws of "fence
months," he gets fish into the market
when no home-caught of the same kind
is to be had.</p>

<p>If all people, both rich and poor, could
be persuaded to eat fish more freely,
they would be benefited both in health
and pocket.</p>

<p>If the <i>demand</i> were greater the <i>supply</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2"> 2 </a></span>
would be more liberal, more varied, and
also much cheaper.</p>

<p>At present, although there is much
complaining about catches falling off,
many grounds yielding but a poor harvest,
yet tons of fish are annually sent
away from the markets for manure.</p>

<p>The trade is both risky and variable,
consequently prices have to be kept up
that the dealer may realise some profit,
and for this state of things <i>the modern
housewife is largely accountable</i>.</p>

<p>It is not wholly a question of price,
although there is still much to desire on
this point.</p>

<p>Ignorance, especially with the working-man's
wife, will generally be found to
be the cause of the aversion which many
housewives have to the cooking of fish;
even in middle and upper class households
much ignorance as to the kinds of
fish and the best means of making use of
them prevails.</p>

<p>The poorer classes still regard fish as
"nothing to make a meal of," and, sad
to say, a great many of the poor of our
cities will not eat fish, however cheaply
they may get it. They have many advantages
of getting it which those who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3"> 3 </a></span>
live in superior neighbourhoods have
not.</p>

<p>Often before the Central Market closes,
first-rate cod is to be had for twopence
the pound&mdash;a seven-pound cod for a
shilling. Plentiful and wholesome as cod
is, it is seldom much thought of by poor
people. Salted, sun-dried cod, is thought
beneath notice, although large quantities
are consumed on the continent, and some
very dainty dishes made therefrom.
Plaice, too, generally to be had at fourpence
the pound, is but lightly esteemed.</p>

<p>Humble Londoners care most for
smoked fish, "something that has a grip
with it," they say. To meet this demand
many adulterations are practised by the
cockney curer. "Haddocks" are often
but indifferent codling. The "Finnan
Haddie" was caught in the Scheldt, and
Stavanger herrings are passed off as Yarmouth
bloaters.</p>

<p>Unwholesome common lobsters, winkles,
and whelks, are preferred to good substantial
fish, and, as before stated, ignorance
of the proper methods of cooking
is most frequently the reason of this.</p>

<p>Where late dinners, with people of
small incomes, are coming more into
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4"> 4 </a></span>
favour, it is found an economy, as it is
also considered the "correct thing," to
have a course of fish. Indeed, as an
economical article of diet, fish has few
rivals.</p>

<p>Many people who really would enjoy
eating it are debarred from doing so by
its being invariably badly cooked, or presented
always in the same monotonous
dress.</p>

<p>Phosphorus being essential for brain
food, and as analysis has proved fish to
contain a greater amount than almost any
other article of diet, it is the more valuable
still on this account.</p>

<p>The fish which afford the most nourishment
are the kinds which most resemble
meat, as salmon, mackerel, &amp;c.; turbot
and halibut, though strictly belonging to
the "lighter" order, are very nourishing
on account of the amount of meat which
they bear in proportion to bone. The
whiter kinds of fish are the most easily
digestible, as soles or cod, whiting, &amp;c.,
and some kinds of river fish, notably
perch.</p>

<p>With the exception of trout&mdash;and perhaps
pike&mdash;fresh-water fish are less
esteemed than they deserve to be.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5"> 5 </a></span></p>

<p>Salmon is sometimes called a river fish,
though genuinely it is not so, as, although
born in the river, the sea is its home and
natural sphere.</p>

<p>In Parisian restaurants many dainty
dishes are prepared from fish caught in
the Seine; and in country places where
sea-water fish is often difficult to obtain,
the ponds and rivers will often furnish
excellent substitutes.</p>

<p>All fresh-water fish&mdash;with the exception
of trout&mdash;is at its best in winter-time.</p>

<p>Shell-fish, perfectly harmless in themselves
as they may be, exemplify the saying
that "what is one man's meat is
another man's poison;" accordingly, where
they are found to disagree they should be
strictly avoided.</p>

<p>Oysters, the most highly esteemed of
shell-fish, are frequently ordered by the
physician when it is desirable to unite
great nourishment with easy digestion,
the amount of gluten they contain giving
them this valuable quality.</p>

<p>Lobsters are popularly considered to
be the least harmful next to oysters,
and the flesh of a fresh crab is both
delicate and delicious.</p>

<p>Shrimps, prawns, and crayfish, should
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6"> 6 </a></span>
properly rank as "relishes"; they are
extremely useful in savoury dishes, either
with or without other fish.</p>

<p>Cockles are deservedly esteemed by
the rich, and they have often staved off
the pressure of starvation from the poor
of our coasts.</p>

<p>The limpet is a great favourite with
the Irish, while the periwinkle is the poor
man's luxury, and the clam enjoys high
favour in the United States.</p>

<h2><a name="PART_I" id="PART_I">PART I.</a></h2>

<p class="caption3"><i>CHOOSING AND BUYING FISH.</i></p>


<p>Before coming to this important part
of our subject, we would like to offer a
suggestion (in all courtesy, be it understood)
to our friends the fishmongers.</p>

<p>Why do they, we would ask, invariably
establish themselves on the sunny side of
the road? Surely if any branch of trade
requires coolness and shade it is the fish
trade, yet how rare an exception to find
one so situated. Then we would respectfully
draw their attention to their way of
handling the fish. Often it receives most
unmerciful treatment, being knocked
about on the marble slab with a force
quite unnecessary. All fish suffer more
or less, but delicate fish, such as soles,
suffer in this way just as a ripe peach or
pear does if subjected to the same treatment.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8"> 8 </a></span>
The same difference can be
detected in the bruised part of fish as
in a bruised peach.</p>

<p>Also a too liberal pouring-on of water
is injurious. No doubt the bright and
well-washed fish, surrounded with lumps
of ice, look far more tempting than the
boat-load all smeared with blood, yet the
fish would be much better if they did not
see fresh water until they are to be
dressed at home. In this matter, however,
the fishmonger is to a large extent
ruled by popular opinion, and if the latter
forbids the purchase of fish in their more
natural condition, he is perhaps justified
in endeavouring to suit the fancy of his
customers.</p>

<p>In choosing fish care should be taken
not to judge too much by first appearances,
although, fortunately, fish, if not
fresh, soon tells its tale.</p>

<p>If the eyes are dull, or the skin and the
scales rub off easily, <i>avoid that fish</i>. If
the skin is bright, the flesh firm to the
touch when pressed between the thumb
and finger, you may rely upon its being
fresh; stale fish, or that which has been
kept long in ice, is always flabby.</p>

<p>One safe general direction for choosing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9"> 9 </a></span>
fish may be given in few words, viz.,
<i>choose the plump ones</i>.</p>

<p>A short fish, thick about the shoulders,
is much to be preferred to a long thin
one. Thick soles, or thick turbots, are far
preferable to thin ones. The same with
codfish.</p>

<p>Lobsters and crabs should be chosen
by weight, and those of medium size are
best in flavour.</p>

<p>There are one or two kinds of fish
which are positively improved by being
kept a day or two, notably skate and red
mullet.</p>

<p>Mackerel, on the contrary, is a fish than
which none spoils more rapidly.</p>

<p>The sole holds a first position among
flat fish, and is deservedly esteemed, as
its flesh is firm and delicate and very
easily digested, hence its great popularity
with the sick. It has also the advantage
of being obtainable all the year round in
good condition. The skin of the back is
sometimes dark, sometimes white, varying
with the nature of the ground on
which the fish feeds. Soles vary in size
from quite little slips, called "tongues,"
to large fish weighing eight or nine
pounds per pair. Those in roe are rather
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10"> 10 </a></span>
insipid in flavour, and are best for filleting.
They vary in price, but are never a
<i>cheap</i> fish.</p>

<p>Halibut is an excellent substitute for
turbot, which it rather resembles in
flavour, and is a comparatively cheap fish.
It is abundant in spring and summertime,
and always a favourite with Jewish
people. Being a very large fish, it is
rarely sold entire. The choice bits are
the flackers over the fins and the pickings
about the head.</p>

<p>A fillet or "steak" is the most profitable
portion for general eating.</p>

<p>Cod is at its best about Christmas time.
From the end of January to March it is
less good and not abundant; in May
again it is generally very fine. The best
are those which are plump and round at
the tail, the sides having a slightly ribbed
appearance, with yellow spots on a clear
skin.</p>

<p>Large cod are not generally cooked
whole, being so much thicker at the head
than at the tail. The head and shoulders,
usually sold apart, form a handsome
dish.</p>

<p>It is a very nourishing fish, valuable in
many ways, and if its "adaptabilities"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11"> 11 </a></span>
were more understood it would be more
generally appreciated.</p>

<p>The salmon has been called the "king
of fresh-water fish," yet, as before remarked,
it does not belong to this
category.</p>

<p>The river is its birthplace, it is true, but
the sea is its pasture ground, where it
returns periodically to renew its strength.
It inhabits fresh and salt water alternately,
spending its summer in the river and its
winter in the sea. Just as the swallow
returns again to the same roof which
sheltered it, so the salmon returns again
to the same river. This fact has been
taken advantage of to naturalise salmon
in rivers where formerly there were no
signs of them. No stranger salmon
cruising along the coast will mistake
another river's mouth for the mouth of
its own river.</p>

<p>The flesh is rich and delicious in
flavour, and to be eaten in perfection it
should be dressed as soon as caught;
there will then be found between the
flakes a creamy-white substance called
"curd," which is highly esteemed by
the epicure. Nevertheless, it is then
highly indigestible; to be perfectly wholesome
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12"> 12 </a></span>
eating the salmon should be kept
twenty-four hours, then the curd solidifies,
and though perhaps less delicate in flavour,
it is richer and far less likely to disagree.</p>

<p>In season from February to August; it
is at its cheapest in July and August.</p>

<p>Salmon trout, though resembling salmon
in flavour and appearance, are really
not at all the same species. They rarely
exceed two to three pounds in weight&mdash;generally
they are but three-quarters of a
pound. They are justly regarded as a
great delicacy, and are at their best in
spring and early summer. The flesh is
sometimes white, sometimes red; the
latter is the most prized.</p>

<p>When choosing salmon trout examine
the inside of the throat through the gills.
If this is very red the flesh will prove to
be red, though not so red as salmon.</p>

<p>There are two or three kinds of trout:
common, sea, and white trout. Sea trout
reaches a good size, white trout never
does. River trout are most delicious and
highly esteemed; the most delicate in
flavour are those which weigh from three-quarters
to one pound.</p>

<p>Trout, which is in season from May to
September, is in perfection in June.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13"> 13 </a></span></p>

<p>Carp and tench are pond rather than
river fish, and both have a great fondness
for burying themselves in mud, and owing
to this the flesh has often a slight muddy
taste; for this reason the fish should lie in
strong salt and water for a few hours, then
be well cleansed in clear spring water.</p>

<p>Both are at their best in the winter
months. The tench, though a smaller
fish, is richer and more delicate than the
carp. They are useful fish to families
residing in the country.</p>

<p>Although the pike attains to a considerable
size in England, it is small in comparison
with its brethren found in Russian
and Lapland waters. Indeed it more
truly deserves to be called a Russian fish,
so much more abundant and popular is it
there. In colour the skin is a pale olive-grey,
with several yellowish spots on the
sides, and the mouth is furnished with a
prodigious number of teeth, which has
earned for it the name of "fresh-water
shark."</p>

<p>It was at one time a very popular article
of food, and is still considered a good fish
for the table. In some countries the fish
is salted and dried, and the roe made into
caviare.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14"> 14 </a></span></p>

<p>The perch, which is one of the commonest
of our fresh-water fish, is also one
of the best. It is met with in almost all
lakes and rivers in temperate regions.
When full-grown it is a large fish,
although one weighing a pound is thought
a good size, and one of three pounds very
large. The flesh is white, firm, of a good
flavour, and easily digested.</p>

<p>Perch are so tenacious of life, they may
be carried fifty miles and yet survive the
journey.</p>

<p>Best used as soon as caught, they are
also better for being crimped as soon as
they leave the water. Their season is
from June to February.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most commonly used fish
is the herring. Shoals of herring visit the
British Islands from the end of May till
October, and even occasionally during the
winter months. In the beginning of the
season the fish is rather oily, and often
found to be indigestible on that account,
but after the first few weeks this disappears,
and then it becomes both digestible
and nourishing.</p>

<p>In choosing herrings take care that they
feel firm, and have bright eyes and scales.</p>

<p>Sprats closely resemble herrings in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15"> 15 </a></span>
appearance and flavour, only they are but
a third of the size of the latter. They are
very abundant on the North British coasts,
and in Edinburgh and Glasgow are sold
by measure. Their best season is the
winter time, and their freshness may be
judged by their silvery appearance&mdash;or
otherwise.</p>

<p>The highly esteemed smelt is a most
delicate fish. When fresh it possesses an
odour like a freshly-cut cucumber, but
this perfume passes away twelve hours
after it has been caught.</p>

<p>The Dutch fisheries furnish very fine
smelts, and the baskets full of bright silvery
little bodies look very tempting in the
wholesale market. These are never what
may be called cheap fish. In season from
November to May. Smelts which have
been split and dried are called sparlings.</p>

<p>Another fish which is cheap and plentiful
in the winter months is the haddock.
They seldom weigh more than from three
to four pounds, and the largest are considered
the best. They should be gutted
as soon as possible, and hung up to dry
with salt inside them. Scotch haddock
have the highest reputation.</p>

<p>Among lesser known fish are the gurnet,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16"> 16 </a></span>
dory, and ling. All of them are
excellent eating. The dory resembles the
turbot in flavour, and the gurnet has firm
white flesh, of agreeable taste. In the
early spring months ling is captured in
large quantities off the Orkney and Shetland
Isles.</p>

<p>Skate and plaice are both less thought
of in England than they deserve to be; in
France they are better appreciated. Skate
improves by being hung up for a day
before using. Young skate are called
"maids," and their flesh is tender and
delicate.</p>

<p>Plaice is in good condition when the
body is thick and firm, the eyes bright,
and the pale side tinged with pink.</p>

<p>Hake, or "white salmon," is a west-country
fish, common in Devonshire. In
season in the autumn months.</p>

<p>Eels and lampreys, very rich, and not
over wholesome, are mostly food for the
epicure. They are useful in cookery
where a succulent dish is required. The

<h2><a name="PART_II" id="PART_II">PART II.</a></h2>

<p class="caption3"><i>THE COOKING OF FISH.</i></p>


<p>The recipes given in this part have been
gleaned from reliable sources. Many of
them are from French cooks, and are
strictly in accordance with the methods
in use in the best "cuisines," where the
cooking of fish receives great care and
attention.</p>

<p>For greater convenience in reference
the recipes for preparing the different
kinds of fish are all classed under the
name of each kind, and the names given
in alphabetical order.</p>

<p>Perhaps the only ways of properly
cooking fish are baking and broiling, yet
these are precisely the ways least practised&mdash;out
of France. Boiling and frying
have hitherto held too great a monopoly
in our methods. In the following pages,
while giving the latter modes their due
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18"> 18 </a></span>
share of attention, we beg to call for
special notice to be given to the examples
for <i>broiling</i>, &amp;c., as they may be relied
upon to bring about a satisfactory result
if carefully followed.</p>

<p>To begin with a few general directions:</p>

<p>In broiling a perfectly clear fire is <i>absolutely
indispensable</i>; more so in the case
of fish than when intending to cook steak
or chops. A shovel-full of good cinders,
slightly wetted, and given sufficient time
to become red-hot, will generally ensure
a good surface heat, but a charcoal "braisi&egrave;re"
is <i>par-excellence</i> the fire for this
purpose, and no French housewife considers
her kitchen complete without this
little contrivance. A little charcoal
sprinkled over some hot coals is not a
bad substitute for it.</p>

<p>A special gridiron should be kept for
fish only. After using, let it be thoroughly
washed and dried, and before using again
rub the bars over with a little oil; fish is
more easily marked, and apt to stick
sooner than meat.</p>

<p>If the gridiron is not a double one, use
a pair of sugar-tongs with which to turn
the fish over; beware of sticking a fork
into it. There can be no doubt that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19"> 19 </a></span>
grilling brings out a flavour which nothing
else will.</p>

<p>What can surpass a fresh mackerel,
grilled after being split open and boned?</p>

<p>An important point to bear in mind in
this method of cookery is, to <i>keep in the
flavour</i>. A slice of grilled salmon will
taste far nicer if the slice has been
wrapped in buttered paper; but cooking
anything in paper requires the greatest
care, as should there be the least flare the
paper will catch fire,&mdash;what is required is
a fierce heat.</p>

<p>When baking fish <i>en papillot</i>, that is
wrapped in buttered paper, the chief
thing to bear in mind is not to spare the
butter. This, one of the most delicate
and delicious ways of cooking fish, is apt
to be entirely spoilt, because only a little
dab of butter is allowed. When fish
has been cooked in paper it should be
sent to table just as it is, paper and all.
Always use plain white note paper, never
printed.</p>

<p>In boiling fish a very common fault is
omitting to put sufficient salt into the
water. In the case of large fish, salt
should be added in the proportion of half
a pound to a gallon of water; for smaller
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20"> 20 </a></span>
fish, a proportion of a quarter-pound to
the gallon is sufficient.</p>

<p>It is now generally thought best to
place fish in nearly boiling water, then
allow it to come gently to the boiling
point again, this keeps in the flavour on
the same principle as the boiling of meat.
The time allowed depends entirely on the
size of the fish, but when the flesh shows
signs of being just able to be separated
from the bone, it is amply done.</p>

<p>Experience is the only safe guide.</p>

<p>To preserve the <i>whiteness</i> of white fish,
it is wise to rub them over with lemon-juice
before boiling.</p>

<p>One method of boiling fish, when it is
intended for eating cold, which is much
approved of on the Continent, is to do it
in "court-bouillon," and if fresh-water
fish be cooked this way it is relieved of
much of its insipidity.</p>

<p>One part of vinegar, one part of red
wine, to four parts of water, for the
"bouillon." To two quarts of the liquor
put an ounce of salt, half an ounce of
pepper, a bunch of savoury herbs, a sliced
onion and a carrot. Sometimes a small
piece of salt bacon is also added. Let
these all boil together for some time, then
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21"> 21 </a></span>
strain the liquor and keep in a stone jar.
It will keep a long time if occasionally
re-boiled.</p>

<p>The fish should be well covered with
the liquid when laid in the fish-kettle, and
allowed to boil gradually.</p>

<p>To fry fish successfully it should be
literally <i>boiled</i> in fat. This cannot be
done over a slow or smoky fire, neither
can it be done unless an abundance of fat
be allowed. It is not an extravagant
method, even if the pan be a large one,
and it takes two or three pounds to fill it.
If carefully poured into a basin containing
boiling water after the fish has been
cooked, the loose breadcrumbs and other
particles will fall to the bottom, and the
fat form a clear white crust. When due
care is exercised there is no reason why
the same fat should not be used fifty times
over.</p>

<p>Let it be quite boiling when the fish is
put in. This may be known by its perfect
stillness and the faint blue vapour which
will rise from it. When the fish has been
washed and carefully dried, flour it before
dipping into beaten egg, and use brown
raspings in preference to breadcrumbs.</p>

<p>Lay a small piece of blotting-paper at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22"> 22 </a></span>
the bottom of the dish to absorb all
grease.</p>

<p>Various recipes for <i>baking</i> fish are
given in the following pages. Perhaps
one of the nicest ways of doing fish in
the oven is <i>au gratin</i>. Briefly described,
this consists of a layer of mixed herbs and
breadcrumbs laid first at the bottom of a
well-buttered dish, the fish laid on this,
then the same ingredients with seasoning
and more butter over it. Very often a
glass of wine or vinegar is added.</p>

<p>Anything cooked <i>au gratin</i> must always
come to table in the dish in which it
was cooked, hence the gratin-dish, sometimes
of silver, sometimes of polished tin
or fire-proof china, is another kitchen
requisite almost indispensable.</p>

<p>When intending to use salted fish for
any dish it should always be allowed to
lie in water at least twenty-four hours
previously, and the water should be
changed frequently; then drain and dry
thoroughly.</p>

<h2><a name="PART_III" id="PART_III">PART III.</a></h2>

<p class="caption3"><i>TESTED RECIPES.</i></p>


<p><b>Anchovies</b> are the only fish which
come under this letter. They are usually
bought in pickle from grocers and oilmen,
and ought to soak in cold water before
they are used. The small, plump ones
are the best&mdash;the pickle is red, the scales
of the fish white. If cut into fillets and
added to sliced cucumber, hard-boiled egg,
also sliced, minced parsley and herbs, and
dressed with the usual salad dressing,
they form an acceptable variety in the
salad series.</p>


<p><b>Anchovies, Essence of</b> (home-made), is
made by beating to a paste half-a-pound
of anchovies, bones also, then adding a
pint of raisin wine to the paste and boiling
both together until it is dissolved. For
seasoning add a very small quantity of
cayenne pepper, two or three Jamaica
peppercorns and three or four shallots.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24"> 24 </a></span>
Home-made essence is greatly superior in
flavour to that which can be bought.</p>


<p><b>Anchovy Butter</b> is prepared by pounding
to a paste half-a-pound of anchovies
with half that weight of butter. A pinch
of cayenne is an improvement. This
butter is especially useful for flavouring
sauces for meat and fish, and if kept in
very small pots, closely covered, it will
remain good for some time. <i>Anchovy
Paste</i>, so much liked for sandwiches, is
made in the same way.</p>


<p><b>Anchovy Sauce.</b>&mdash;Two ounces of
butter melted, two tablespoonfuls of flour
mixed smoothly with it, a tumblerful of
boiling water. When this has boiled stir
in gradually three teaspoonfuls of the
essence of anchovies, and add the juice
of half a lemon; let all boil once more,
then pour into a tureen.</p>


<p><b>Barbel.</b>&mdash;This is but a poor fish, being
woolly and rather flavourless. It may be
made palatable by cutting in pieces, then
steeping in a marinade of oil, pepper and
salt, for half an hour, after which broil the
pieces over the fire, and serve with <i>ma&icirc;tre
d'h&ocirc;tel</i> butter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25"> 25 </a></span></p>


<p><b>Bloaters.</b>&mdash;The smoked bloaters should
be scalded with boiling water, then dried.
The bones can often be drawn off after
this, before cooking. They may either
be broiled over the fire for a moment, or
cooked in the oven with a morsel of
butter.</p>

<p>Before broiling fresh bloaters split
them open down the middle, remove the
backbone and cleanse them. Sprinkle
with pepper and salt, and drop a morsel
of butter on each before bringing to table.</p>


<p><b>Bream</b> is a handsome, although not
a delicate fish. It must be thoroughly
cleansed and washed out with vinegar.
Split it open and remove the bone, but
do not scale it. It is best broiled, but is
excellent if stuffed with a little forcemeat,
then baked in the oven for twenty minutes.
Melted butter, caper sauce, or anchovy
sauce, must accompany it to table.</p>


<p><b>Brill.</b>&mdash;This fish has an excellent reputation,
resembling turbot so nearly; it
may be cooked in almost every way recommended
for the latter. Thick brill
are the best, and a yellowish hue in the
flesh denotes its freshness. Lay it in
salted water for a few minutes, then dry
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26"> 26 </a></span>
it and rub with the juice of a lemon.
When boiling brill allow plenty of salt in
the water, and half a teacupful of lemon
juice. Let it simmer gently after reaching
boiling point till just tender through. Lay
on a clean serviette, the white side uppermost,
garnish with cut lemon and parsley,
also a sprinkling of lobster coral.</p>


<p><b>Carp, Baked.</b>&mdash;After washing and
scaling, remove the inside of the carp,
squeeze over it the juice of one or two
lemons and let it lie thus for an hour.
Next place it in a baking tin, sprinkle
some minced parsley and shallots over it,
also pepper and salt, then pour a little
oiled butter over all. Cover with white
paper and bake for upwards of forty
minutes&mdash;gently. Make a little thick
melted butter, enrich it further with a
spoonful of cream, stir in the juice of half
a lemon, and more salt and pepper&mdash;cayenne
if liked. Lift the carp on to a
dish, pour this sauce over it, garnish with
chopped gherkins and lobster coral.</p>


<p><b>Carp, Fried.</b>&mdash;Cut the fish into fillets
after having thoroughly cleansed it. Roll
each fillet in flour seasoned with salt and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27"> 27 </a></span>
cayenne. Fry in a depth of boiling fat,
serve with anchovy sauce.</p>


<p><b>Carp, Grilled.</b>&mdash;Only very small carp
can be cooked this way, and they should
be wrapped in buttered papers, after
having been washed and emptied. Serve
with a piquant sauce of minced herbs,
lemon-juice and butter.</p>


<p><b>Carp, Stewed.</b>&mdash;Carp are excellent
treated this way if rather large. After
washing in vinegar and water, cut the fish
into fair-sized pieces, roll each piece in
seasoned flour, then lay in a covered
stewpan, and pour a tumblerful of white
wine over them. Allow nearly an hour
for the cooking, then when done remove
the pieces of fish carefully on to a dish,
stir in a tablespoonful of grated horseradish,
a little cream, and the beaten yolk
of an egg into the sauce, and pour it over
the carp.</p>

<p>If boiled in "court-bouillon," carp is
equally good for eating cold.</p>


<p><b>Caveach Fish.</b>&mdash;Clean some large fish,
such as cod or salmon, then cut them into
slices. Rub each slice with salt, pepper
and spice, and fry in boiling fat till lightly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28"> 28 </a></span>
browned. Let them drain and get quite
cold, then lay in deep jars. Boil some
vinegar with a few shallots, peppercorns,
a bay leaf and blade of mace; when this
is cold fill the jars nearly full with this,
pour a little salad oil on the top and cover
closely. They will keep for months, and
when required the slices are lifted out,
placed in the centre of a dish with dressed
salad round them.</p>


<p><b>Clams.</b>&mdash;Clams, which are a species of
cockle, were declared by the great Soyer
to be superior to the oyster in flavour.
They are very nice if fried, after dipping
into beaten egg and breadcrumbs. In
America they are stewed. Put into a
stewpan with a little water, they are
boiled for a few minutes, then seasoned
with pepper and salt.</p>


<p><b>Cockles.</b>&mdash;Cockles should be roasted
on a tin laid on the top of a stove; they
are eaten whilst hot with bread and
butter. They require to be well washed,
and the shells scrubbed with a brush.</p>


<p><b>Cod, Baked.</b>&mdash;Take a piece weighing
about three pounds out of the middle of
a large fish. Make a simple forcemeat
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29"> 29 </a></span>
of breadcrumbs, minced parsley, thyme,
seasoning, and the yolk of an egg; put
this inside the fish and sew it up. Place
in a baking-dish, and surround with a
carrot sliced, and also a turnip and small
onion. Pour a spoonful of vinegar over,
and place two or three lumps of butter on
the top; bake for twenty minutes. Remove
the vegetables, but serve the liquor
with the fish instead of sauce.</p>


<p><b>Cod, Fried &agrave; la Ma&icirc;tre d'H&ocirc;tel.</b>&mdash;Take
two or three slices of cod about an
inch and a half in thickness, let them lie
in salt water for half an hour, then drain
and dry them. Cover with seasoned flour,
and fry in a quantity of boiling fat for a
few minutes. Pile in pyramid form on a
hot dish, pouring the following sauce
round them: two tablespoonsful of fresh
green parsley chopped small, two ounces
of butter, half an ounce of flour, a little
salt, pepper, and a spoonful of vinegar;
add a little water if it thickens too much.
Mix the ingredients well, let them boil up
once, then serve.</p>


<p><b>Cod, &agrave; la Cr&egrave;me.</b>&mdash;The remains of
boiled cod will do excellently well for
this, or if fresh fish is used it must be first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30"> 30 </a></span>
boiled till tender, then broken into flakes,
all skin and bone removed. Into a saucepan
put a pint of milk with a teaspoonful
of salt and the rind of a lemon. Let this
boil once, then pour off into a basin. In
the saucepan melt an ounce of butter and
stir in smoothly an ounce of flour, add a
pinch of cayenne pepper, then the milk,
and boil all together until thick. Put in
the flakes of cod to heat through, then
pour all on to a hot dish, garnish with
tufts of parsley, and pass round strips of
toasted bread to eat with it.</p>


<p><b>Cod, Curried.</b>&mdash;Take the remains of
cold boiled cod broken into flakes, fry
them a moment in butter. Lay them
aside on a hot plate and prepare the
curry. For this put an ounce of butter
into a saucepan and slice into it two
shallots and one small apple. When
these have frizzled brown stir in a tablespoonful
of flour, half a teaspoonful of
curry powder, the same of salt, and a
pinch of cayenne pepper, and lastly a teacupful
of stock. Let this boil a few minutes,
then put in the cod to warm up, and serve
quickly. A wall of boiled rice round the
edge of the dish is an improvement.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31"> 31 </a></span></p>


<p><b>Cod, Salted, with Parsnips.</b>&mdash;Take a
couple of pounds of salted cod, let it soak
for twenty-four hours, then drain, and
pouring fresh cold water over it let it heat
through gradually. It should simmer until
tender, but must not boil, or it will become
hard. Drain again, lay on a hot dish,
garnish with boiled parsnips cut into
lengths, and cover all with egg sauce,
made as follows: half a pint of milk
thickened with flour, a small bit of butter,
salt, pepper, the juice of a lemon, and
two hard-boiled eggs chopped small and
stirred in. Garnish the dish with parsley.</p>


<p><b>Cod, Salted, en Mousse.</b>&mdash;Soak and
cook the cod as in the previous recipe,
then drain and break into flakes. Frizzle
a slice of a Spanish onion in a small
quantity of butter, but do not brown it.
Scald the soft part of a slice of white
bread, break it with a fork, then add to
the onion, and at the same time add
gradually a cupful of new milk. Continue
to beat until all is quite smooth, sprinkle
with salt and pepper, then add the flakes
of cod, still continuing to beat. If becoming
too stiff add more milk. When
all is light and like a froth, pour on to a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32"> 32 </a></span>
dish and dot small bits of fried or toasted
crusts about the surface.</p>


<p><b>Cod, Head and Shoulders Boiled.</b>&mdash;A
portion or the whole of a large fish,
when intended for boiling, should be previously
crimped, when it should receive
some deep cuts as far as the bone on both
sides. Afterwards it should lie in vinegar
and water for half an hour. It should be
plunged at once into boiling water, then
allowed to simmer till just tender. Drain,
and serve on a white d'oyley, garnished
with lemon and parsley. Crimping renders
the flesh firmer, and makes it easier both
to cook and to serve.</p>


<p><b>Crab.</b>&mdash;The crabs which have a rough
shell and claws are the best. When
choosing one shake it well; if it rattle it
is sure to prove watery. The shell should
be of a bright red, and the eyes look clear.
In picking out the meat from the shell
and claws leave out the part near the
head, which is not fit to be eaten.</p>


<p><b>Crab, Hot Buttered.</b>&mdash;Pick the meat
from the shell of a crab, mix with half its
quantity of breadcrumbs, a little pepper,
salt, grated nutmeg, a spoonful of salad
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33"> 33 </a></span>
oil and the same of vinegar. Clean the
empty shell, then refill it with this mixture,
sprinkle more crumbs over the top, then
a nob of butter, and bake for nearly ten
minutes. To eat with hot dry toast.</p>


<p><b>Crab, Salad.</b>&mdash;Pick the meat from the
shell into flakes, make a pile in the centre
of a dish, leaving the claws on the top;
surround with shred lettuce and watercress,
and pour a simple salad dressing
over all.</p>


<p><b>Crab Soup, or Potage Bisque.</b>&mdash;This
is most delicious and delicate. Choose a
nice heavy crab, pick out the meat from
the claws into shreds. The soft meat from
the inside of the body is pounded in a
mortar with half its quantity of boiled
rice; this is thinned a little with some
clear stock, then passed through a colander.
Put this into a stewpan with
sufficient stock to make the required
quantity (veal stock is preferable), add
a cupful of thickened cream, salt to
taste, and a little cayenne pepper, let it
boil once only, then take from the fire
and add the shredded meat from the
claws. A little lobster butter stirred in
will make it a richer colour.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34"> 34 </a></span></p>

<p>Make potage from lobster or crayfish
in exactly the same manner. The result
will be almost as satisfactory.</p>


<p><b>Crayfish.</b>&mdash;Crayfish resemble lobsters
in flavour, but they are smaller, and the
flesh is more delicate. Those which are
red under the claws are the best. Wash
them well, and boil in salt water for ten
minutes, after which they will become a
bright red. Drain well, then pile in
pyramid form, and garnish with parsley.</p>

<p>A pretty dish may be made from them
by preparing a clear savoury jelly, and
arranging the crayfish in a fancy mould&mdash;minus
the tails&mdash;filling in all spaces with
the jelly.</p>


<p><b>Crayfish, as a Breakfast Relish.</b>&mdash;Remove
the tails from a pint of crayfish,
put the bodies to simmer gently in a
saucepan with an ounce of butter, a
teacupful of water, a spoonful of vinegar,
grate of nutmeg, and a little salt and
pepper. Simmer for ten minutes, thicken
with flour, and pour over a slice of toast.</p>

<p>Crayfish may also be potted like
shrimps.</p>


<p><b>Dabs.</b>&mdash;These insignificant little fish
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35"> 35 </a></span>
are caught in the mouths of rivers near
the sea. They are nice if fried, but more
tasty if wrapped in buttered paper and
baked for fifteen minutes. Send to table
with sliced lemon.</p>


<p><b>Dace.</b>&mdash;This fish scarcely repays the
trouble of cooking, and is usually only
enjoyed by the angler who has caught it.
It may be either fried or boiled. A little
sharp sauce with lemon juice and mustard
are almost necessary accompaniments.</p>


<p><b>Dory.</b>&mdash;Although by no means a handsome
fish, yet the dory has a flavour
which makes it excellent eating. It is
best boiled, or rather <i>simmered</i>, after it
has boiled once, twenty minutes for a
fair-sized fish. Serve on a napkin, garnished
with parsley. Anchovy, shrimp,
or caper sauce, are all suitable for serving
with boiled dory.</p>


<p><b>Eels, en Matelote.</b>&mdash;Skin and clean
about two pounds of eels, divide into
pieces of two inches long, let them lie
in salt water while some onions are being
fried in butter. When the onions have
browned, stir in flour to absorb all the
butter, then a cupful of stock and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36"> 36 </a></span>
same of red wine, a few mushrooms,
pepper and salt, and a pinch of herbs.
Stew the eels in this gravy until thoroughly
tender, about forty minutes. Serve altogether.</p>


<p><b>Eels, Boiled, for Invalids.</b>&mdash;When
the skin has been drawn off the eel, and
it has lain in salt water to cleanse it, it
should be placed before a clear fire for
ten minutes to draw out the oil. Wash
again in warm water, and set to boil in
a saucepan with a bunch of parsley and
spoonful of salt. When tender take it
out, divide into lengths, thicken a small
quantity of the broth, add cream and
chopped parsley, and pour over the eel.</p>


<p><b>Findon, or "Finnan," Haddocks.</b>&mdash;The
Findon haddock, so highly esteemed
for its delicate flavour, may be distinguished
by its odour and creamy yellow
colour. The skin should be stripped off,
and the fish broiled quickly over a clear
fire. Rub butter over it before bringing
to table.</p>


<p><b>Flounders.</b>&mdash;Flounders may be boiled,
baked, fried, or stewed. As they are apt
to have a slight muddy flavour, they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37"> 37 </a></span>
should lie in salt water for a while.
Perhaps the nicest way of cooking them
is to dip them into beaten egg, cover
with raspings, and boil them in fat.</p>

<p>Flounders may also be done <i>au
gratin</i>, by laying the fish (neatly trimmed)
on a bed of chopped shallots and parsley,
breadcrumbs and butter, covering them
with the same, then adding a glass of white
wine, and baking for twenty minutes.
Allow at least one for each person.</p>


<p><b>Gurnet.</b>&mdash;The head of the gurnet is
large in comparison with the rest of the
body. It is apt to be a dirty fish, and
needs very thorough cleansing. The gills
should be cut off. Perhaps the best way
of cooking it is to remove the head and
the inside, stuff it with a forcemeat, sew
the body up and lay it in a deep tin,
covering with a slice or two of salt fat.
Bake for half an hour, then remove on
to a hot dish, and pour <i>ma&icirc;tre d'h&ocirc;tel</i>
butter over it.</p>


<p><b>Haddock, Broiled.</b>&mdash;Draw and clean
the haddock very thoroughly, wiping it
perfectly dry. Dredge with flour, then
pour a little salad oil over it. Lay on the
gridiron and broil quickly. When brown
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38"> 38 </a></span>
and crisp it is done. Serve with anchovy
sauce.</p>


<p><b>Haddock, Baked.</b>&mdash;Empty and wash
the fish, scaling it carefully; let it lie in
vinegar for fifteen minutes, then dry it,
dredge with flour, cover with beaten
egg, then with breadcrumbs, and lay in
a greased baking-dish. Pour melted
butter over it, and bake about twenty
minutes. The gravy which comes from
the fish may be seasoned and sent to
table with it. Garnish with cut lemons.</p>


<p><b>Haddock, Curried.</b>&mdash;Choose small
haddocks for this purpose. Split them
open, remove bones and the head, divide
into convenient-sized pieces. Dip each
piece into seasoned flour and fry till crisp
and brown. Prepare a curry sauce by
frizzling a small onion and an apple in
butter, thickening with flour, adding
seasoning and a little curry powder and
clear stock to make the requisite quantity.
Put the fish into this sauce to heat through,
then pile in the centre of a dish and pour
the sauce over. Garnish with rice.</p>


<p><b>Halibut.</b>&mdash;Being very large fish, perhaps
the most satisfactory way of dealing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39"> 39 </a></span>
with halibut is to cut them into steaks,
viz., slices across the fish of any thickness
desired. They may be either broiled or
fried. When broiling, sprinkle them with
seasoning, and let them lie in salad oil
for a few minutes, then drain and broil
quickly over a bright fire. Lay on a hot
dish, squeeze lemon juice over, and
sprinkle with chopped parsley.</p>

<p>For frying, the steaks may be either
dredged with flour, or dipped in egg
and breadcrumbs, then fried in a shallow
depth of fat till lightly brown. Drain on
blotting paper, and send shrimp or
anchovy sauce to table with them.</p>

<p>Boiling is the least satisfactory way of
cooking halibut, but if it be chosen, have
the fish in one thick piece. Put into
boiling water, and simmer gently until
the fish shows signs of parting from the
bone.</p>


<p><b>Halibut Pie.</b>&mdash;Take a piece of the
middle of the fish, remove all skin, and
cut into pieces an inch square. Roll each
piece in a mixture of salt, pepper, and
breadcrumbs, place in a pie-dish with
lumps of butter at the top. Pour a glass
of white wine over. Cover with a "short"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40"> 40 </a></span>
crust, and when this has baked until well
brown, the fish also will be done.</p>


<p><b>Herrings, Boiled.</b>&mdash;Few fish are more
delicious than fresh herrings boiled.
Wash, scale, and empty them very particularly.
Souse them with vinegar, then
drop into boiling salted water, simmer for
about ten minutes, and lift them out the
moment they are done. Drain them,
arrange nicely on a clean napkin, garnish
with parsley and horseradish, and serve
parsley sauce with them.</p>


<p><b>Herrings, Broiled.</b>&mdash;Let them lie in
salt overnight, wash them, empty, and
split them open. Dry thoroughly, and
dredge a little flour over them. Lay on
an oiled gridiron, broil on both sides.
Lay each one separately on a hot plate,
and place a morsel of butter on the top.
Then pour the following sauce over them:
a tablespoonful of chopped parsley, the
same of minced herbs, and a "suspicion"
of onion, same of butter, a teaspoonful of
salt and pepper mixed, a wineglassful of
vinegar; boil altogether for a moment.</p>


<p><b>Herrings, Pickled</b> (to eat cold).&mdash;Scale
and clean the herrings carefully, split
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41"> 41 </a></span>
them open and take out the backbone.
Sprinkle with salt and pepper after laying
in a deep dish. Cover with vinegar and
water. Bake till tender through.</p>


<p><b>Herrings, Pickled</b> (French mode).&mdash;Scale
and clean the herrings, empty
without splitting them. Cut off the
heads, and put the fish into an earthern
jar, strew salt liberally over them; let
them lie twenty-four hours. Drain them
and place them in an enamelled saucepan
with a dozen peppercorns, a bay-leaf or
two, and an onion with a clove. Cover
with cold vinegar. Let them come to
boiling point, and boil two minutes only.
Stand aside until quite cold, when they
may be placed in a covered jar. They
will keep good for some time.</p>


<p><b>Lampreys, Stewed.</b>&mdash;Rub the lamprey
well with salt, and wash it in water
(warm) to get rid of the slime. Cut off
the head, tail, and gills, empty it, then
cut into pieces three inches long. Slice
three or four onions into the bottom of a
stewpan, dip each piece of lamprey into
flour, and lay over the onions. Add next
a dozen mushrooms, a tablespoonful of
chopped parsley, grated lemon-rind and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42"> 42 </a></span>
a little juice, pepper, and salt. A glassful
of red wine and sufficient stock to cover
the whole, replace the lid, and stew
gently for two hours. Serve altogether.</p>


<p><b>Ling, Baked.</b>&mdash;Cleanse and empty the
fish, cut it into thick slices, removing the
head and tail. Dredge the slices with
flour, and sprinkle with salt and pepper.
Lay them in a baking-dish, and pour
some melted butter over them. Bake for
twenty minutes, place the slices of fish
on a hot dish, then add a cupful of cream
and a small tinful of button mushrooms
to the butter, make thoroughly hot and
pour over the fish just before bringing to
table.</p>

<p>Or, the slices of ling may be dipped
into beaten egg, covered with raspings,
and fried in hot fat, a <i>sauce r&eacute;moulade</i>
being brought to table with them.</p>


<p><b>Lobster, &agrave; la Cr&egrave;me.</b>&mdash;Pick the meat
from a fresh lobster without breaking
the shell; cut it into dice. Put into an
enamelled saucepan with a mixed teaspoonful
of salt, pepper, and nutmeg, a glassful
of white wine, a tablespoonful of vinegar,
and an ounce of butter rolled in flour.
Simmer gently for ten minutes, stirring
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43"> 43 </a></span>
all the time. Then stir in two tablespoonfuls
of thickened cream. Pour the
mixture into the shell of the lobster,
cover the top with breadcrumbs, brown
quickly in the oven, then set the shell on
a folded napkin, and garnish with parsley.</p>


<p><b>Lobster Cutlets.</b>&mdash;A large lobster is
required for these. Boil for five minutes,
then crack the shell and take out the
meat as whole as possible. Cut this
across in slices a quarter of an inch in
thickness. Dip each slice into beaten
egg and breadcrumbs, sprinkle with salt
and pepper, and fry in fat for about five
minutes. Make a small mound of whipped
potato for the centre of a dish, arrange
the cutlets round this, and send oyster
sauce to table with them.</p>


<p><b>Lobster Patties.</b>&mdash;Boil a lobster for
fifteen minutes. Crack it open and pick
the meat out into flakes. Put the flakes
into an enamelled saucepan with an ounce
of butter, a tablespoonful of cream, same
of white stock, and a teaspoonful of
essence of anchovies, a little seasoning
also, and a few dry breadcrumbs. Boil
up for a moment. Line some patty-pans
with good puff paste not rolled too thinly,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44"> 44 </a></span>
place a morsel of crumb of bread in the
middle before putting on the top crust;
bake the patties a bright brown, lift off
the top crust, take out the bread, fill with
the hot mixture, and replace the cover.
Serve very hot.</p>


<p><b>Lobster Salad.</b>&mdash;For this the lobster
is required very sweet and fresh; it
should have been boiled about twenty
minutes and then have become quite
cold. Crack the shell and remove the
meat as whole as possible, saving the
coral for garnishing. Divide the meat
into small neat pieces, seasoning each
with salt, pepper, and vinegar. Take two
lettuces with firm, white hearts, wipe
them clean with a cloth. They must be
crisp and perfectly dry. Place first a
layer of shred lettuce at the bottom of a
bowl, then a layer of seasoned lobster;
alternate till the stock is exhausted. Pour
the following dressing over all at the last
moment, and sprinkle the coral over the
surface. A fanciful outer edge may be
made of sliced eggs and beetroot, or
nasturtium flowers, radishes set in parsley,
&amp;c.</p>

<p><i>Dressing</i>.&mdash;The yolks of two eggs beaten
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45"> 45 </a></span>
until thick, a saltspoonful of salt, half of
pepper, same of made mustard. Beat in
slowly half a pint of oil and two spoonsful
of vinegar.</p>


<p><b>Lobster Butter, and Sauce.</b>&mdash;The
spawn and coral of a freshly-boiled hen
lobster, pounded together in a mortar
with twice their quantity of fresh butter
and a spice of cayenne pepper, makes
lobster butter. It should be of a bright
red colour. Keep in small pots well
covered, and in a cool place.</p>

<p>For the sauce, make some good plain
melted butter, pick out a few flakes of
the white meat of a lobster, then stir in
a spoonful of the lobster butter. Do not
boil it after this, or the colour will be
spoilt. The juice of a lemon may be
added if liked.</p>


<p><b>Mackerel, Broiled.</b>&mdash;For a perfectly
fresh, small, plump mackerel, this is <i>the</i>
mode of cooking <i>par excellence</i>.</p>

<p>Cleanse the fish thoroughly, and dry
them first with a cloth, then by hanging
up in the open air. Split them open
flat and carefully remove the backbone.
Smear them with salad oil, sprinkle them
with salt and pepper, wrap each one
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46"> 46 </a></span>
in a fold of buttered note-paper, and lay
on the gridiron. Broil carefully over a
clear <i>red</i> fire for twenty minutes, turning
occasionally. They may be broiled
without the paper, in which case
fifteen minutes will be more than long
enough, but will taste less delicate and
be less easily digested. Lay on a hot
dish, cover closely, and serve with or
without <i>ma&icirc;tre d'h&ocirc;tel</i> butter.</p>


<p><b>Mackerel, Baked.</b>&mdash;Large mackerel
are preferable for this mode. After cleaning
and taking out the roes, fill with the
following forcemeat:&mdash;Three ounces of
breadcrumbs, an ounce of finely-shred
beef suet, the same of chopped parsley,
a pinch of savoury herbs, minced chives,
and pepper and salt. Bind the mixture
with a beaten egg. When the fish has
been filled, sew the sides together with
strong thread, lay it on a baking dish,
dredge a little flour over it, and pour over
either some melted butter or clarified
fat. Bake twenty minutes. Serve with
the same butter to the which some
chopped parsley has been added, or with
a <i>sauce piquante</i>.</p>


<p><b>Mackerel, Boiled.</b>&mdash;Wash and empty
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47"> 47 </a></span>
them without splitting them more than
can be helped. Lay them in <i>hot</i> water
with plenty of salt. Let the water come
to a boil, then draw aside and simmer
them till the skin shows signs of breaking.
Drain, and serve on a clean serviette.
Garnish with parsley. Serve either
parsley or fennel sauce with them.</p>


<p><b>Mullet, Red.</b>&mdash;These fish are much the
best if cooked in buttered paper. They
may be roast, baked, or boiled&mdash;all ways
are excellent if the precaution of wrapping
up be observed. A liberal share of
butter should be enclosed with them.
The gills and fins only are removed; the
inside remains untouched, as the liver
is much esteemed. Cook them about
twenty-five minutes, take out of the
papers, and serve with plenty of sauce
in a tureen. Add the liquor which has
oozed from the fish to some plain melted
butter, with a spoonful of anchovy sauce,
a squeeze of lemon juice, and a glassful
of some good red wine.</p>


<p><b>Mullet, Red</b> (Broiled <i>&agrave; la ma&icirc;tre
d'h&ocirc;tel</i>).&mdash;Clean the mullet and empty
them, score them across in several places,
lay them to soak in a marinade of salad
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48"> 48 </a></span>
oil and minced sweet herbs&mdash;garlic also
if the taste is liked. Let them lie in this
for half an hour. Drain them, sprinkle
with salt and pepper, lay on a gridiron,
and broil over a clear fire, turning on
both sides.</p>


<p><b>Mullet, Grey.</b>&mdash;The grey mullet is but
seldom offered for sale. It is generally
thought much inferior to the red, and
is only seasonable during the heat of
summer. It may be cooked in any of
the ways given for mackerel or for red
mullet.</p>


<p><b>Oysters.</b>&mdash;Oysters are never so excellent
or so easy of digestion as when they
are eaten straight out of the newly-opened
shell. If carefully opened, and none of
the juice be spilt, they will need no
seasoning; but if it be preferred, salt and
pepper may be sprinkled over them, also
a squeeze of lemon juice. Brown bread
and butter is the usual accompaniment to
them.</p>


<p><b>Oysters, Browned in their own
gravy.</b>&mdash;This is a very dainty dish. Take
a dozen or more large oysters, open them
carefully, and pour the juice from each
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49"> 49 </a></span>
one into a cup. Take off the beards, dip
each oyster into beaten egg thickened
with flour. Brown them in a little butter,
lift them out, add the gravy from the cup
to the butter, thicken with flour, and
season with pepper and salt. Let it
simmer for two or three minutes, then
stir in the browned oysters; let them
heat through again, then pour over a slice
of toast.</p>


<p><b>Oysters, au Gratin.</b>&mdash;Butter a bright
tin or silver gratin-dish. Stir into a few
ounces of breadcrumbs a spoonful of
chopped parsley and sweet herbs with
seasoning. Sprinkle these thickly over
the butter, and moisten with white wine.
Then split open two dozen large oysters,
take off the beards, and lay each oyster
on the bed in the dish, pouring the juice
over as well. Cover them with a few
more crumbs, place three or four nobs of
butter on the top, and bake in a moderate
oven for ten minutes. Bring to table in
the dish.</p>


<p><b>Perch.</b>&mdash;The best way of dressing
perch is in <i>water souchy</i>. Remember
always to clean the perch first with a little
warm water to take off the slime, then
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50"> 50 </a></span>
lay them in cold salt water for an hour
or so. Pick out the smallest of the fish
for the <i>souchy</i>, empty them, cut into
pieces, boil them slowly with some
parsley-root, peppercorns, and salt. Strain
the broth (for the ingredients should boil
until a strong broth is obtained) through
a muslin. The large perch should be
crimped, after being cleaned, then placed
in the broth and simmered until just
tender. Drain them, serve in a deep dish
with a ladleful of the broth poured over
them, and garnished with green parsley.
A little fresh parsley, chopped, may be
introduced into the broth if liked.</p>

<p>Perch may also be laid in a marinade
(after being cleansed) then broiled over
the fire. It is well if, after lifting them
out of the marinade, they are liberally
besprinkled with seasoned breadcrumbs
and herbs. Broil till lightly browned, lay
on a hot dish, a nob of butter on each,
and garnish. Serve a little sharp sauce
with them.</p>

<p>If economy is not to be studied, they
are very nice if stewed in wine&mdash;sherry,
or equal parts of sherry and clear stock.
Lay the perch in a deep dish, and just
cover them with the above. Slice an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51"> 51 </a></span>
onion very thinly, lay over them with a
few sprigs of parsley, thyme, a bay-leaf,
and some peppercorns, sprinkle liberally
with salt, and let them simmer gently
for about twenty minutes. Make a sauce
from the liquor by thickening it with
butter rolled in flour, and serve poured
over the fish.</p>


<p><b>Pike, Baked.</b>&mdash;Pike must be scaled
after washing them. To scale it easily,
first pour boiling water over the fish, then
plunge immediately into cold water, and
scrape briskly with the back of a knife.
Wipe the fish dry, then empty it, and fill
the cavity with a nicely seasoned forcemeat,
sew up the sides, and lay in a
baking dish. Lay several large lumps of
butter about it, and pour over a glassful
of white wine or clear broth. Bake it in
a moderate oven for half an hour&mdash;a large
fish will take even longer. It should be
basted frequently, being a dry fish. Good
beef dripping will answer as well as
butter. When done, lift the fish carefully
on to a hot dish, and thicken the gravy
with flour; add a spoonful of anchovy
sauce, the same of mushroom ketchup,
cayenne pepper, and salt. Let them boil
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52"> 52 </a></span>
up again, then stir in a spoonful of capers,
and pour the sauce into a tureen. The
fish may be garnished with horseradish,
fresh parsley, or small ripe tomatoes, if
available.</p>

<p>Pike may be boiled, letting it lie in
vinegar some time previously, and placing
it in very hot water or stock, with an
onion and bunch of sweet herbs. Bring
to a boil, and then simmer until tender.
Serve it on a clean napkin with cut lemons
and parsley; send a sharp sauce to table
with it.</p>

<p>The remains of cold boiled pike, or
slices cut from a fresh fish, may be dipped
into egg and breadcrumbs and fried in
fat. They will be found very good, especially
if accompanied by a dish of green
vegetable, as spinach, or a fresh salad.</p>


<p><b>Plaice.</b>&mdash;Perhaps the very nicest way
of dressing plaice is to cut the fish into
fillets, then to dip these into beaten egg
and raspings, and fry them. Place each
fillet on a round of fried bread, and put
a tiny pat of anchovy butter on the top
of each, giving a sprinkle of pepper and
salt as well, and thus they will be found
to be very appetising.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53"> 53 </a></span></p>


<p><b>Plaice, au Gratin.</b>&mdash;Steep the fish in
salt water for an hour or two, cleanse and
empty it, leaving the head untouched.
Dry it thoroughly, and take a dish that
will just hold it. First melt a little beef
dripping in that, then put a layer of
crumbs, a tablespoonful of finely-minced
suet, parsley, shallots, and seasoning. On
this lay the plaice, white side uppermost,
cover with the same order, and squeeze
the juice of a lemon over the top. Set in
the oven, which should be hot enough
to brown the surface quickly. Twenty
minutes is ample for a good-sized fish.
Serve in the same dish.</p>


<p><b>Plaice, Boiled.</b>&mdash;Large plaice should
be chosen for boiling. Cut a slit from
the head downwards through the middle
of the back, to prevent the white side
breaking. Lay it in the fish-kettle with
sufficient <i>cold</i> water to cover it, and a
teacupful of vinegar. Let it come quickly
to boiling point, then simmer for about
five minutes longer. Serve with shrimp
or caper sauce.</p>


<p><b>Prawns.</b>&mdash;Prawns much resemble
shrimps, but are larger in size and more
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54"> 54 </a></span>
delicate in flavour. When fresh they are
of a bright red colour, and very firm.</p>


<p><b>Prawn Soup.</b>&mdash;Mince together till
quite fine, a carrot, onion, stick of celery,
and small turnip. Melt a little butter in a
stewpan, put in the vegetables and let
them simmer for a quarter of an hour,
stirring well about. Heat a quart of clear
stock, take a thick slice of white bread
and cut it into dice, leaving out the crust,
let it boil in the liquor, then add the
vegetables with the butter, and a tablespoonful
of salt. Boil all together. Take
fifty prawns, pick out the tails, and stew
the bodies in a glass of wine, press them
through a colander and mix with the
soup. Add then a pinch of cayenne
pepper, a teaspoonful of anchovy butter,
and a dessert-spoonful of lemon juice.
Allow all to boil five minutes longer, and
pour over fried croutons into a tureen.</p>


<p><b>Ray, or Maids.</b>&mdash;This fish is the
young skate, and, like the latter, it is
improved by being hung for a day. It is
nicest if cut into fillets and fried. It may
be boiled for a few minutes in "court-bouillon,"
or, after being par-boiled, it
may be cut into slices, dipped in oil,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55"> 55 </a></span>
dredged with flour, and laid on a gridiron
to broil for a few moments longer.
Minced parsley and shallots simmered in
butter, with a tablespoonful of vinegar,
and seasoning of pepper and salt, should
form a gravy to accompany the fillets.</p>


<p><b>Roach.</b>&mdash;The roach is a small fresh-water
fish of a firm compact flesh. It is
best fried. Wash and empty the fish,
dredge flour over them when dry, fry
them in hot fat for about five minutes.
Send anchovy or some very tasty sauce to
table with them.</p>


<p><b>Salmon.</b>&mdash;For boiling purposes choose
salmon with small heads and thick
shoulders, or if buying only a portion of a
fish, choose a piece of the middle or the
head and shoulders.</p>

<p>After cleaning the fish, cut off the fins
and gills and scrape the scales carefully.
Lay it in <i>nearly</i> boiling water with plenty
of salt in it; let the water well cover the
fish. Allow the water to come to boiling
point, then boil gently until a silver fork
will pass through the thickest part. As a
general rule allow eight minutes to the
pound if the fish is a thick one, five or six
minutes if it be a thin one. Experience
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56"> 56 </a></span>
is the only safe guide. It is well to wrap
the fish in a thin linen cloth before putting
it in the pan; only be careful in removing
the cloth when the fish is done, lest it be
broken. Lay the fish on a folded napkin,
and garnish with tufts of parsley, tomatoes,
and a few prawns.</p>


<p><b>Salmon, Broiled.</b>&mdash;For broiling purposes
slices across the fish about an inch
thick are preferable. If nicely cut and
rubbed with a little melted butter,
sprinkled with pepper and salt, laid on
the gridiron and broiled on both sides over
a very clear hot fire, turning every two or
three minutes till done, then laid on a hot
dish with a pat of fresh butter on each
cutlet, and garnished with whatever is
best obtainable, they are indeed truly
admirable. Shrimp sauce, or <i>ma&icirc;tre
d'h&ocirc;tel</i> butter might accompany them. A
dish of green peas, either plainly boiled,
or saut&eacute;d in butter, is a most delicious
accompaniment to salmon cutlets.</p>


<p><b>Salmon, Baked.</b>&mdash;Take a piece two or
three pounds in weight, either from the
middle or the tail end. Lay it in a deep
pie-dish, surround it with a few small
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57"> 57 </a></span>
shallots and sound red tomatoes, dredge
a little flour over it, sprinkle with pepper
and salt, lay several small pats of butter
on the top, and pour a glassful of white
wine into the dish. Place the dish in a
moderately hot oven and bake for from
three-quarters to an hour. When done,
lift the fish on to a dish and keep hot
while preparing the sauce. Press the
tomatoes and shallots through a colander
or hair sieve, add to the liquor in the dish,
with also a teaspoonful each of made
mustard, vinegar, flour, and Worcestershire
sauce; let this boil up once, then
pour round the fish. Garnish with curled
parsley and a few choice tomatoes. Serve
whipped potatoes with it, and cucumbers
sliced in vinegar.</p>


<p><b>Salmon Crumbs.</b>&mdash;A dish much liked
in the North of Ireland.</p>

<p>The remains of cold boiled salmon are
divided into flakes and mixed with half
their quantity of stale breadcrumbs, a
tablespoonful of fresh butter, pepper, salt,
a spoonful of vinegar, and one or two
beaten eggs. Butter a shallow pie-dish,
strew with crumbs, then press the mixture
into it, and bake till brown. Any nice
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58"> 58 </a></span>
sauce, or a freshly-dressed salad, may be
served with this dish.</p>


<p><b>Salmon Fritters.</b>&mdash;Take the remains
of cold cooked salmon, remove the skin
and bone and break the flesh into flakes.
Mix with these an equal quantity of
mashed potatoes, add pepper and salt
and an egg to bind the whole together.
Make the mixture into small flat cakes or
fritters, coat each one with beaten egg,
and dredge with flour; melt a little nice
dripping in a shallow frying-pan, fry the
fritters first on one side, then on the
other, till they are a nice brown colour,
drain and keep hot while preparing the
following:&mdash;The heart of a crisp white
lettuce, shred, and piled in the centre of a
dish, two hard-boiled eggs shelled and
minced small, strewn over this; make a
dressing with salt and pepper, one spoonful
of vinegar and two of oil, the whole of
a shallot, some chives and parsley finely
minced, all mixed together, then poured
over the lettuce. Sprinkle a little lobster
coral over the surface, place the fritters
round the base, and serve at once. This
is a nice supper dish.</p>


<p><b>Salmon Trout.</b>&mdash;These are rightly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59"> 59 </a></span>
esteemed a great delicacy. They may be
dressed and served according to the
recipes given for salmon, although boiling
is the least suitable method. As they
seldom exceed two or three pounds in
weight, it scarcely repays to fillet them.
For broiling they may be treated like
mackerel, but, better still, when they have
been duly cleansed and scaled, wrap them
in buttered paper, and either bake them
in the oven or broil them on the gridiron.
Baking is the best method of cooking
salmon trout, but, when small, they are
very good if dipped bodily into batter,
then plunged into boiling fat, and served
with <i>ma&icirc;tre d'h&ocirc;tel</i> sauce.</p>


<p><b>Salmon Trout, Baked and Stuffed.</b>&mdash;A
good-sized trout is very nice if baked
as follows:&mdash;After emptying and scaling
the fish, fill the cavity with a stuffing of
breadcrumbs, parsley, herbs, and an egg
to mix it; sew the sides together if
necessary. Lay in a baking dish, dredge
with flour, place butter on the top, put
a tablespoonful of vinegar and one of
stock into the dish, and bake in the oven
from twenty minutes to half an hour. Lift
the fish out on to a dish, thicken the liquor
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60"> 60 </a></span>
with flour, add seasoning, a spoonful of
chopped parsley, a teaspoonful of anchovy
essence, and pour this sauce round the
fish. New potatoes, green peas, or baked
tomatoes should accompany this dish.</p>


<p><b>Sardines.</b>&mdash;Tinned sardines are generally
eaten without any further preparation,
although very nice sandwiches may
be made from them, also they are an
indispensable adjunct to a fish salad.</p>

<p>Fresh sardines should be first cleansed,
then dried in a soft cloth, laid on the
gridiron and broiled for about two
minutes. Sprinkle salt and pepper and a
dash of vinegar over them, and serve very
hot on toasted bread.</p>


<p><b>Shad.</b>&mdash;Shad does not enjoy a very
high reputation in England; in France it
is quite a favourite fish and is thought
worthy of being cooked in wine, and
served with B&eacute;chamel sauce. Its best
season is the early spring-time, March to
May. The French way of cooking it is to
split it open, after emptying, scaling, and
washing it, then to lay it in oil, with
pepper and salt. After it has soaked in
this marinade for a sufficient time, it is
laid on the gridiron, and broiled <i>very
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61"> 61 </a></span>
slowly</i>, on both sides, for upwards of an
hour. Served with <i>ma&icirc;tre d'h&ocirc;tel</i> butter
or caper sauce. Shad may be fried after
first trimming into convenient-sized pieces
and dipping each piece in frying batter.
It may also be stuffed and baked according
to instructions given for salmon trout.</p>


<p><b>Shrimps.</b>&mdash;There are several varieties
of shrimps. The two kinds most commonly
met with are the brown and the
red shrimps. The brown kind is caught
nearest to the shore in the shallower
pools, and has the strongest flavour. The
red shrimp is generally much smaller
in size and more refined in flavour.
When freshly boiled, shrimps are excellent
as a breakfast relish, but when
stale they are far from wholesome. Allow
a good handful of coarse salt to the quart
of water when boiling; as soon as they
have attained a nice colour they are done.</p>


<p><b>Shrimps, Potted.</b>&mdash;In potting shrimps,
after they have been well boiled, take care
to pick off both heads and tails and to
twist them dexterously out of the shells.
As a good quantity of shrimps are required
to make a small amount, it is as
well to benefit by an opportunity of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62"> 62 </a></span>
shrimp sauce being required, and so set
aside the heads and tails to be used for
the latter purpose. After having thoroughly
pounded the bodies of the shrimps in a
mortar, put in a small saltspoonful of salt
and the same of pepper, and one or two
ounces of fresh butter. Pound all well
together, press into small pots, and pour
clarified butter on the surface to exclude
the air.</p>

<p>Shrimp butter is made in the same way,
only adding an <i>equal</i> quantity of butter
to the paste. Neither of these will keep
good many days.</p>


<p><b>Shrimp Forcemeat</b>, for stuffing sea or
fresh-water fish.</p>

<p>Shred some shrimps and add to them
an equal quantity of fresh breadcrumbs.
To a tablespoonful of fresh butter add a
saltspoonful of seasoning, and a beaten
egg. Make the shrimps and crumbs into
a stiff paste with this. Particularly good
as a forcemeat for pike and carp.</p>


<p><b>Shrimp Patties.</b>&mdash;(The same mixture
is used for shrimp "vol-au-vent"). Pick
off the heads and tails from freshly-boiled
shrimps, and shell them. Put the shells
into a saucepan, cover them with water,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63"> 63 </a></span>
and boil gently for a quarter of an hour.
Strain the liquor, then thicken it with a
teaspoonful of arrowroot, add the yolk of
an egg, salt and pepper to taste, a small
nob of butter, stir all together over the
fire; when it is of the consistency of cream,
put in the bodies of the shrimps to heat
through and draw the saucepan to one
side until required. Make some good
puff paste, line the patty pans, and put a
morsel of soft bread in the middle before
putting on the cover. Bake the patties to
a nice brown, then remove the bread, replacing
it with a spoonful of the mixture,
put on the cover, brush over the surface
and edges with beaten yolk of egg and
water, return the patties to the oven to
heat them through again, then send to
table on a pretty d'oyley. They are very
good also for eating cold. If liked, the top
crust may be omitted, and a few breadcrumbs
be sprinkled over the top of the
mixture. Garnish the dish with curly
parsley and a few large shrimps.</p>


<p><b>Shrimp Canap&eacute;s.</b>&mdash;A nice entr&eacute;e.
Cut some small rounds from a stale loaf
of bread, fry them in oil or lard to a delicate
brown, then cover each with a layer
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64"> 64 </a></span>
of either potted shrimps or shrimp butter.
Hard boil two eggs. Remove the yolks,
and pound them with a small bit of butter
and a pinch of pepper and salt. Cut the
whites into thin strips. Lay the strips in
a lattice work over the rounds and place a
pat of the yellow mixture in the middle of
them, and a whole shrimp on that, or the
very tiniest sprig of parsley. Make a bed
of fresh dry parsley on a dish to lay the
rounds upon.</p>


<p><b>Skate.</b>&mdash;Skate is an unwholesome fish
if eaten out of season. Its best time is
during the winter months, and it is positively
improved by being kept for a day
or two hung up. However it is dressed it
should always be skinned first. The liver
is a choice morsel.</p>

<p>A method of dressing skate which is
much liked by French people, is to do it
<i>&agrave; la Sainte M&eacute;nehould</i>. For this it should
be skinned and cut into neat pieces, then
simmered in white sauce till tender; the
pieces of fish should then be lifted out on
to a shallow dish, the sauce to receive the
addition of a yolk of egg and pinch of
cayenne pepper, then to be poured over
the fish, Parmesan or Cheshire cheese
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65"> 65 </a></span>
grated over the top. Set the dish in the
oven to get thoroughly hot again.</p>

<p>For boiling, large skate are preferable
to small ones, and when possible they
should be crimped. (N.B.&mdash;Crimping can
only be done when the fish is perfectly
fresh.) It should be plunged into boiling
salt water, then gently simmered till
tender. Let it drain well.</p>

<p>Boiled skate is very good served with
"Black Butter" sauce. For this last, a
quarter pound of butter should be allowed
to frizzle in a saucepan until of a light
brown colour, then a few washed and
dried parsley leaves should be thrown in,
a tablespoonful of tarragon vinegar, ditto of
mushroom ketchup, Worcestershire sauce,
and chopped capers, pepper and salt to
taste. Let these boil once, then either pour
over the fish or send to table in a tureen.</p>

<p>Skate may also be fried, curried, or
stewed, according to directions given for
other fish.</p>


<p><b>Smelts.</b>&mdash;Smelts should be handled as
little as possible; not washed, but wiped
with a cloth. The inside should be
pulled out with the gills, as they must
not be opened.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66"> 66 </a></span></p>

<p>It is most usual to fry smelts. Boiling
is not to be recommended, unless for an
invalid, in which case they should be put
into boiling water which contains a few
parsley leaves and a lump or two of sugar
as well as salt; four minutes cooking is
ample time. A little of the liquor in
which they were boiled should receive
the addition of cream and chopped
parsley, and be served with them.</p>

<p>For frying, smelts should be first dipped
into beaten egg, then into mixed flour
and breadcrumbs, afterwards fried in a
good depth of boiling fat. Lift them out
with a slice, drain well, and garnish with
cut lemon.</p>

<p>Smelts are delicious as a breakfast relish
if laid on a gridiron and broiled lightly on
both sides, then placed on a hot dish,
sprinkled with pepper and salt, lemon
juice squeezed over, and a pat of butter
placed on each.</p>

<p>They may also be baked <i>au gratin</i>, and
served in the same dish.</p>


<p><b>Soles.</b>&mdash;The popular method of cooking
this favourite fish is to fry them.
Some persons declare it to be the best
method. If it be so or not, certain it is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67"> 67 </a></span>
that the following ways, when fairly
tried, will be found to compete very
closely in favour. <i>Very</i> large soles may
be boiled whole, and will be found most
agreeable eating, not unlike turbot in
flavour. When practicable, soles should
be cleansed a couple of hours before they
are wanted for cooking, wrapped in a
towel and laid in a cool place to stiffen.
The fishmonger will generally skin them;
if not, it is easy to draw the skin off the
back beginning at the head, gut them, and
take out the roe, if any.</p>


<p><b>Soles, Fried.</b>&mdash;Medium sized fish are
the best for frying whole, or if large they
should be filleted. After cleansing them
be careful to wipe <i>very</i> dry, then dip them
first into flour, next into beaten egg, and
cover with bread raspings. Fry quickly
in plenty of boiling fat. From five to ten
minutes is the time a moderate sized sole
will require&mdash;but when of a rich colour it
is generally cooked sufficiently. Lay on
a wire sieve or blotting-paper to drain
before putting on to a dish. Garnish
with cut lemons and parsley, either fresh
or fried.</p>


<p><b>Sole, Boiled.</b>&mdash;Let the sole be large,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68"> 68 </a></span>
thick, and firm; it should not weigh less
than two pounds. Wrap it in a clean
white cloth (a napkin which is too old for
table use is best), plunge it into boiling
salted water with a tablespoonful of
vinegar, let it boil very gently for about
seven or eight minutes, according to size,
then drain well, lay carefully on a clean
napkin. Garnish with sliced tomatoes
and lemons, and tufts of parsley. Send
to table either melted butter, shrimp, or
anchovy sauce.</p>


<p><b>Soles, Baked au Gratin.</b>&mdash;Melt an
ounce of butter in a gratin-dish, or tin
baking dish. Chop finely two or three
shallots, a small bunch of parsley, and
few herbs, grate a slice of stale bread.
Sprinkle half the quantity of these at the
bottom of the dish, lay the sole upon that
and cover with the remainder. Pour
either a glass of white wine or the juice
of a lemon over all, lay a few bits of
butter at the top, and bake in a quick
oven for twenty minutes. Serve in the
same dish, sprinkled with salt and pepper.
Or soles are very nice if laid in a buttered
dish, having rubbed them with flour, more
butter placed on the top, and baked till
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69"> 69 </a></span>
lightly browned. They may be lifted on
to another dish, but the butter should be
served with them.</p>


<p><b>Sole &agrave; la Normande.</b>&mdash;This is an
epicure's dish. After skinning and cleaning
a large sole, dry it thoroughly and rub
with flour. Take a gratin-dish, or a
porcelain one which will stand fire. Slice
two shallots very thinly, brown them in
butter, and lay at the bottom of the dish
with more butter. Lay the sole in the
dish, sprinkle it with salt and pepper, and
cover with a glass of white wine. Bake
in a gentle oven until tender through.
Meanwhile make some rich white sauce
with cream; if possible, take a few oysters,
beard them, and put them into the sauce
with their liquor; let the sauce merely
simmer after this. Open a small tin of
button mushrooms, mince them finely,
and strew them over the sole, let them
get hot through, then pour the oyster
sauce over all. Garnish with a few
shrimps, and place tiny croutons of fried
bread round the edge.</p>

<p>Cider may be used instead of wine.</p>


<p><b>Soles, Filleted.</b>&mdash;Fillet a large sole by
slitting it down the middle of the back,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70"> 70 </a></span>
and with a sharp knife raising the flesh
from the bone on each side. Divide the
meat into convenient sized pieces, say
two inches broad and three long, make a
marinade of salt, pepper, vinegar, and oil,
lay the fillets in this, turning them often,
and let them lie an hour or so. Prepare
a frying batter&mdash;a heaped spoonful of
flour mixed smooth with a little oil and
cold water, a pinch of salt, and the whites
of two eggs&mdash;it should be fairly thick.
Well coat each fillet with this, then drop
into boiling fat, and fry till a nice brown.
Garnish prettily, and serve with tomato
sauce.</p>

<p>The fillets of sole may be dipped into
egg and bread raspings, fried, then laid in
the following sauce to heat through, before
serving altogether: half a pint of clear
stock thickened with a tablespoonful of
flour, mixed smooth with butter, a tablespoonful
of mushroom ketchup, a teaspoonful
of curry powder, the same of
tarragon vinegar, and a pinch of salt.
Let the sauce be well cooked before
putting in the fillets.</p>

<p>The fillets, or small soles whole, may
be gently simmered in butter till tender,
then laid on a hot dish, and white sauce
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71"> 71 </a></span>
seasoned with salt, pepper, and lemon
juice, be poured over them. If the soles
be <i>boiled</i> for two minutes only before
putting them in the butter, and the sauce
be made with cream, this will be found a
most delicious way of dressing them for
invalids.</p>


<p><b>Sprats.</b>&mdash;Sprats resemble herrings very
closely. They are abundant on the North
British coasts, particularly in the Firth of
Forth. In Edinburgh and Glasgow they
are known as "garvies." They may be
cooked in any of the ways prescribed for
herrings, but are best broiled over the
fire, and lemon juice improves the flavour
of them.</p>


<p><b>Sturgeon.</b>&mdash;The sturgeon is somewhat
of a rarity in English markets, although
common enough in Russia. It is regarded
as a royal fish, and is proportionately costly.
Its flesh is delicious, and the caviare which
the Russians prepare from the roe is justly
esteemed a great delicacy.</p>

<p>The Russian method of dressing it is to
par-boil it in water with onions, herbs,
and baysalt, then to drain it, dredge it
with flour, and pour melted butter liberally
over it, then to lay it before a bright
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72"> 72 </a></span>
fire to roast, serving with a rich sauce,
either poured over it, or in a tureen.</p>

<p>Sturgeon is very good if simply roasted
before the fire, taking care to baste frequently
with butter. Of course all the
skin and spikes are previously stripped
off, and the fish well cleansed.</p>


<p><b>Sturgeon, Stewed.</b>&mdash;This is one of
the best ways of cooking a portion of this
fish. Take two or three slices about an
inch thick, let them steep in vinegar
awhile. Dry them, dip in flour, and
place in some frothing butter in a covered
stewpan. Let them brown on both sides,
then remove the fish, and in its place put
a few shallots, half a small carrot cut into
dice, and some button mushrooms. When
these have browned, cover them with half
a pint of clear veal broth, a good tumblerful
of claret, a teaspoonful of salt and
pepper mixed, then replace the slices of
sturgeon. Let all stew together for upwards
of an hour, when remove the fish
on to a dish, strain the sauce from the
vegetables, thicken it with a little flour
rolled in butter, and add a spoonful of
some sharp sauce. Pour over the fish on
the dish.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73"> 73 </a></span></p>


<p><b>Tench.</b>&mdash;River tench are the best for
the table. They somewhat resemble carp,
but are smaller in size and of a richer
flavour. They should lie in salt water for
a few hours, then be turned into clear
spring water, to rid them of the slight
muddy flavour which they are apt to have.
The cold winter months are their best
season.</p>

<p>Empty and scale the tench very carefully,
always removing the gills, as they
are most apt to retain the muddy flavour.
After the fish is cleansed it is a good plan
to rub it well over with lemon juice. It
may then be baked <i>au gratin</i>, or boiled in
salt water, or broiled over the fire. If
the last-named method be chosen, let the
fish be steeped in oil, sprinkled with salt
and pepper, and wrapped in oiled paper
before laying on the gridiron. Great care
is needed not to let the paper catch fire.
Remove the paper before bringing to table,
lay the fish on a hot dish and serve a
<i>sauce piquante</i> over it.</p>

<p>The time it takes to cook will depend
entirely on the size of the fish. Broiling
will require about ten minutes to the
pound; boiling and baking rather less
time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74"> 74 </a></span></p>

<p>Tench is also good if fried. After
scaling and cleaning it should be dipped
into vinegar and water, dried, and split
open; dredge it with flour, and plunge
into boiling fat. Serve garnished with
parsley and lemons.</p>


<p><b>Trout, Baked.</b>&mdash;One of the nicest
ways of dressing trout is to simply bake
them with butter. Wash, empty, and
dry the trout, sprinkle them with seasoned
flour, lay in a baking tin in which a little
butter has been melted, place several pats
of butter over them, and bake about
twenty minutes. Lift them out on to a
dish, garnish with parsley, thicken the
butter slightly, stir in a spoonful of
chopped parsley and a squeeze of lemon
juice, and pour the sauce round the
fish.</p>


<p><b>Trout, Boiled.</b>&mdash;Fresh trout is excellent
if boiled in "court-bouillon" for
ten to fifteen minutes, then drained and
served with Dutch sauce or melted butter.
This method is similar to that recommended
by the great Izaak Walton.</p>


<p><b>Turbot.</b>&mdash;The turbot is the king of
flat fish, and is justly held in high estimation.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75"> 75 </a></span>
It is rather an expensive fish, and
is mostly sold by size. At its best from
February to August. It will keep good
for a day, or even two, if slightly salted.
Salt should be rubbed all over to help
to remove the slime. The fins should
not be cut off, but an incision should be
made all the way down the middle of
the backbone on the <i>dark</i> side to prevent
the white side cracking. Lemon juice
rubbed over it helps to preserve the
colour. Any unsightly spots on the white
side may be removed by rubbing with
salt and lemon juice.</p>


<p><b>Turbot, Boiled.</b>&mdash;After preparing the
turbot according to the directions given
above, lay it in the turbot kettle and
cover with cold water to the depth of an
inch. Allow a good handful of salt to a
gallon of water. Bring it up to boiling
point as quickly as possible, and remove
the scum as it rises. When it boils draw
it aside to simmer gently, watch it carefully,
and as soon as it shows signs of the
flesh shrinking from the bone, lift it out
on the drainer, let it drain a minute, then
slide it carefully on to a clean napkin.
Garnish with parsley, cut lemons, and if
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76"> 76 </a></span>
a few crayfish are obtainable they add
greatly to the beauty of the dish. A
sprinkling of lobster coral on the white
surface is very pretty.</p>

<p>Whatever sauce accompanies boiled
turbot, it should be brought to table in a
tureen.</p>

<p>A pretty way of garnishing boiled
turbot in summer time is to surround it
with a border of nasturtium flowers.</p>


<p><b>Turbot, with Anchovy Cream.</b>&mdash;Boil
a medium sized turbot according to the
last recipe&mdash;by the way, a turbot ought
to be thick and of a creamy white colour;
if thin and bluish looking it is not a good
one. Lay the fish on a hot dish without
a napkin, cover to keep it hot. Then
into half a pint of plain melted butter,
stir in a good teaspoonful of essence of
anchovies, and a quarter of a pint of rich
cream; let it nearly boil, then pour over
the turbot. Chop small a few pickled
gherkins and capers, strew them over the
surface. Before bringing to table, make a
border round this of new kidney potatoes,
well boiled but not broken; garnish the
outer edge with parsley.</p>


<p><b>Turbot &agrave; la B&eacute;chamel.</b>&mdash;This is one
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77"> 77 </a></span>
of the best ways of dressing cold turbot.
Make a pint of B&eacute;chamel sauce by boiling
together equal quantities of good white
stock and cream in an enamelled saucepan,
also a strip of fresh lemon rind and
two or three shallots. Add a mixed teaspoonful
of salt and pepper, thicken with
a spoonful of arrowroot, and let it boil
well. Remove the lemon rind and
shallots, and put in the pieces of turbot
to heat through, all skin and bone removed.
When quite hot, pour all together on to a
hot dish; if liked, a few oysters may be
added to the sauce just before turning it
out. Some potato croquettes are a nice
addition to this dish.</p>


<p><b>Turbot Salad.</b>&mdash;The remains of cold
turbot will make an excellent salad. Free
it from all skin and bone, and divide into
pieces about an inch square. Sprinkle
the pieces with salt and pepper and a
little vinegar. Take two large fresh
lettuces, let them be quite clean and dry.
Make a dressing for the salad of the
beaten yolks of two eggs, a teaspoonful of
made mustard, salt and pepper, four
spoonsful of oil, and one of tarragon
vinegar. Arrange the salad in a bowl or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78"> 78 </a></span>
dish by making a layer of shred lettuce
leaves, then one of fish, and a few spoonsful
of the dressing, and continue thus
until the material is used up. Garnish
the top with sliced beetroot, hard-boiled
eggs, &amp;c., and let the salad stand in a
cold place for half an hour.</p>

<p>Turbot may be cooked <i>au gratin</i> if of
a small size, allowing white wine or cider
to it. French cooks generally prefer to
par-boil it in "court-bouillon," then to take
it out and finish cooking it in white sauce.</p>


<p><b>Whitebait.</b>&mdash;Whitebait are genuine
Cockney fish, being found alone in the
Thames in perfection. They make their
appearance early in the year, but the
season <i>par excellence</i> is the month of May.
They cannot be had too fresh; if not used
instantly they are brought in, they should
lie in ice-water until required.</p>

<p>It is generally thought that only a
"professional" can cook whitebait, but if
due care be given there is no reason why
they should be beyond the skill of the
amateur. The principal thing to observe
is the <i>drying</i> of the fish. After well draining
them they should be thrown on to a
floured cloth&mdash;a cloth containing flour an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79"> 79 </a></span>
inch in depth. When thus dosed, the
fish should be put into a sifter and lightly
shaken to remove all superfluous flour.
They should next be put into a wire
basket, a few at a time, and plunged into
a pan containing a good depth of boiling
fat. A minute generally suffices to cook
them, then they should be laid on a hot
dish, garnished with fried parsley, and
sent to table instantly. It is absolutely
needful to fry the whitebait the moment
after it is floured; if allowed to remain on
one side for only a few minutes, it becomes
flabby and spoilt. Thin brown bread and
butter and slices of lemon are an indispensable
accompaniment to whitebait.
For "Devilled Whitebait" lift out the
basket of fish when only half cooked,
pepper them with black or cayenne
pepper and return to the fat to finish
cooking.</p>


<p><b>Whiting.</b>&mdash;Whiting are excellent fish
when fresh, the flesh being light, tender,
and easy of digestion. The firmness of
the flesh, and its silvery hue, are the signs
by which to judge of its freshness. It is
more or less in season all the year, but at
its best in the winter months. Occasionally
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80"> 80 </a></span>
they attain to a considerable size, but
are mostly from one to two pounds in
weight. Those about nine inches in
length are the best in point of flavour.</p>

<p>Whiting are best broiled or fried.</p>


<p><b>Whiting, Broiled.</b>&mdash;Wash in salted
water, split them open, and dry thoroughly.
Dip them in oil, sprinkle with seasoning,
dredge with flour, and then lay on a
greased gridiron, and broil lightly on both
sides. Place them on a hot dish, put a pat
of butter on each, and serve smoking hot.</p>


<p><b>Whiting, Fried.</b>&mdash;Empty, and wash
the fish, skin it, and then draw the tail
through the mouth. Dip each one first
into flour, then in beaten egg and breadcrumbs,
drop into boiling fat, and fry to
a golden brown. Garnish the dish with
fried parsley, and send sauce to table in a
tureen.</p>

<p>A large whiting may be split open,
floured, and then fried in a smaller
quantity of fat. When done, lay it on a
dish and pour the following sauce over it:
A tablespoonful of minced herbs, the same
of parsley, a pinch of seasoning, an ounce

<h2><a name="PART_IV" id="PART_IV">PART IV.</a></h2>

<p class="caption3"><i>FISH SAUCES</i>.</p>


<p>A few plain directions as to the making
of sauces suitable for serving with fish,
will, we think, not be unwelcome. First
as to that sauce commonly known as&mdash;</p>


<p><b>Melted Butter.</b>&mdash;In France this sauce
is what its name declares it to be, viz., a
tureen half full of pure butter dissolved,
in strong contrast to that generally found
on English tables, where a mixture of
milk and water thickened with flour, is
usually dignified with this title. True
"butter sauce" belongs to neither of these
extremes. As one ladleful will generally
suffice for each individual partaking of
fish, it is as well to measure into the
saucepan the number of ladlefuls that
will be required, so that there shall be no
waste of good material.</p>

<p>Having ascertained how much liquid
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82"> 82 </a></span>
will be in the saucepan when the sauce is
finished, pour away the water and proceed
to divide the materials you will use.
A small lump of butter should be allowed
for each ladleful of sauce. Take one
lump and let it dissolve, then stir in a
heaped tablespoonful of dry flour, mix
these quite smoothly together, with the
addition of cold water, until like a cream;
add boiling water to make half the
quantity of sauce, then stir in by degrees
the remaining lumps of butter. If the
sauce shows signs of looking oily, a little
cold water will correct it. A pinch of
salt should be added, or salt butter may
be used.</p>


<p><b>Ma&icirc;tre d'H&ocirc;tel Butter.</b>&mdash;For this
prepare a little melted butter, by mixing
an ounce of butter with the same weight
of flour, and cold water to make it smooth.
Dilute with a quarter of a pint of white
stock. Let this mixture boil, then stir in a
tablespoonful of chopped parsley, one of
sweet herbs, half one of minced chives, a
teaspoonful of mixed salt and pepper, the
juice of a lemon, or a spoonful of tarragon
vinegar, and a spoonful of pure oil; when
these have been well mixed together,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83"> 83 </a></span>
draw aside the saucepan and stir in the
beaten yolk of an egg, then pour into a
hot tureen.</p>


<p><b>Herb Sauce: for Broiled Fish.</b>&mdash;Chop
some dry parsley until quite fine,
also an equal quantity of mixed herbs&mdash;thyme,
marjoram, sage, chervil, celery,
fennel, &amp;c. Put first a small lump of
butter to dissolve in the saucepan, and
chop finely a shallot and let it frizzle in
this, then stir in the parsley and herbs,
and add sufficient vinegar to cover them.
Draw the saucepan aside and let it
simmer ten minutes to abstract the
flavour. Just before it is wanted, add
pepper and a pinch of salt, also a good
tablespoonful of oil. A yolk of egg, added
lastly, will slightly thicken and improve it,
but it is very good without, especially for
broiled herrings and mackerel.</p>


<p><b>Anchovy Sauce.</b>&mdash;Anchovy sauce is
quickly and easily made according to the
recipe given in the previous chapter (see
letter A), but if a richer sauce is desired,
the anchovies should be boiled gently
until they dissolve. Then the liquor be
strained, added to a little plain melted
butter with a glass of port wine.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84"> 84 </a></span></p>


<p><b>Shrimp Sauce.</b>&mdash;For this the foundation
is again "melted butter," and to half
a pint of that allow half a pint of shrimps.
Pick off heads, tails, and shells, and let
the bodies stew gently in the sauce, but
not boil, or they will harden. Add a
pinch of cayenne pepper, a little lemon-juice,
a drop of anchovy essence, and salt
to taste.</p>


<p><b>Lobster Sauce</b> can be made in the
same way, using a little of the white meat
of the lobster torn into flakes, in place of
the shrimps, and stirring in a spoonful of
lobster butter. It must not boil or the
colour will be spoilt. To give this sauce
a stronger flavour of lobster, the shell may
be boiled in water, and the liquor used
instead of water.</p>


<p><b>Fennel Sauce.</b>&mdash;Pick some fennel from
the stalk and boil it for a minute, then
chop it fine and add to some "melted
butter." Stir in the yolk of an egg the
last thing. A teaspoonful of spiced vinegar
will give piquancy to it.</p>


<p><b>Parsley Sauce.</b>&mdash;Parsley sauce is
merely "melted butter" with chopped
parsley stirred in. It is an improvement
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85"> 85 </a></span>
to let the sauce boil a moment or two
after to take off the raw flavour.</p>


<p><b>Horseradish Sauce.</b>&mdash;To two tablespoonsful
of finely-scraped horseradish
and one of stale white breadcrumbs allow
half a pint of cream&mdash;or new milk and
cream&mdash;and a pinch of salt. Let this
stew for fifteen minutes, then stir in a
spoonful of vinegar just before serving.</p>


<p><b>Gooseberry Sauce, for Mackerel.</b>&mdash;Stew
half a pint of gooseberries in a little
water until very soft, press them through
a sieve into the same quantity of "melted
butter," add an ounce of white sugar, and
a spoonful of spinach-juice to give a nice
green colour.</p>


<p><b>Egg Sauce.</b>&mdash;<i>First Way</i>: Make some
good "melted butter," stir into it two or
three hard-boiled eggs which have been
cut up small, and season it well. Just
before serving stir in the beaten yolk of a
fresh egg.</p>

<p><i>Second Way</i> (for cold fish): Beat the
yolks of two fresh eggs, stir in a teaspoonful
of made mustard, half a teaspoonful of
mixed salt and pepper, and by degrees
two tablespoonsful of salad oil and one of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86"> 86 </a></span>
tarragon vinegar. It should be of the
consistency of cream. This sauce is
almost identical with "Mayonnaise"
sauce, and to make a green mayonnaise
add finely-minced chives, parsley, chervil,
and cress.</p>


<p><b>Tomato Sauce.</b>&mdash;Melt an ounce of
butter, and slice one or two tomatoes
thinly into it, add one or two shallots.
Let these stew till quite soft, then press
through a wire sieve. Add a little more
butter to this pur&eacute;e, plenty of salt and
pepper, and a spoonful of vinegar. Make
thoroughly hot before serving.</p>


<p>Regard should always be had to contrast
of colour in garnishing all dishes.
Where the fish is masked in white sauce,
the introduction of something red amongst
the green garnishing is a relief to the eye.
Flowers may be used to supply this needful
touch of colour, slices of beetroot, or
a few strips of boiled carrot, or a few
bright prawns, one or two chilies, &amp;c.</p>

<p>If a portion of salmon, showing the
bright colour of the meat, is the dish
which has to be trimmed, a few mounds
of scraped horseradish alternating with
tufts of curly parsley looks well.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87"> 87 </a></span></p>

<p>For fried fish&mdash;soles, fillets, lobster cutlets,
&amp;c., it is better to fry the parsley
which is used for their garnishing.
Double-curled parsley, well dried, thrown
into a wire basket and plunged into the
boiling fat, for one minute only, is the
way to obtain this.</p>

<p>Crisp, fried croutons of bread, tiny
potato balls, rice balls, sliced lemons,
small bright tomatoes, and slices of hard-boiled
egg, are all excellent for garnishing
purposes.</p>

<p>Fish that has been baked in the oven&mdash;excepting
always that which has been
done <i>au gratin</i>, and which requires no
garnish&mdash;will often be made to look very
pretty if a few fancy shapes be stamped
out of cooked vegetables, say the red of
a carrot, the white of a turnip, tiny sprigs
of cauliflower, &amp;c., always using green
parsley to finish off the outer edge.
Where there is the will to do it, means
will not be lacking whereby the simplest
dish may be made to look elegant.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
